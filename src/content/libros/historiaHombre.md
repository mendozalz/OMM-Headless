## Subtitulo

An h1 header
Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. Italic, bold, and monospace. Itemized lists look like:

this one
that one
the other one
Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts at 4-columns in.

Block quotes are written like so.

They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis. Unicode is supported. ☺

An h2 header
Here's a numbered list:

first item
second item
third item
Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters from the left side). Here's a code sample:

## Let me re-iterate ...
for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

import time
## Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
An h3 header
Now a nested list:

First, get these ingredients:

carrots
celery
lentils
Boil some water.

Dump everything in the pot and follow this algorithm:

find wooden spoon
uncover pot
stir
cover pot
balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
wait 10 minutes
goto first step (or shut off burner when done)
Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including that last line which continues item 3 above).
